__Q:__ Can a basic Node.js web application framework be composed from multiple single-line functions, each with a length of 100 characters or fewer?

__A:__ Yeah, more-or-less.


## Challenge Rules
* Each function may only be a single line long
* Each function definition must not exceed 100 characters in length
    * Length limit does not include assignment (`module.exports = `, etc.)
    * Length limit does include formal parameters (`(x, y, z) => {}`)
* Functions must be short, but readable: include spaces
* Prefer pure functions where possible
* Semicolons are prohibited
* Comments are required to help understand what each function does
* Unit tests and 100% code coverage are required
* All code must run in strict mode


## Demonstration
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ConnorWiseman/one.git
cd one
npm i
npm start
```

Pop open a browser and hit `http://localhost:3000`, then watch your console.


## To-do List
* Implement some form of URL request routing
